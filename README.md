RDF::AcidRepository
===================

This is now the default in-memory Repository for RDF.rb (since:
https://github.com/ruby-rdf/rdf/pull/260). This will stay here for
historical purposes.

~~This is an in-development in-memory `RDF::Repository` using functional
datastructures.

You maybe can't see the point of this, yet. It's work in progress;
taking advantage of the benefits of the functional data structures is
next on the list. :)

When work has progressed a bit further, this will likely move to a new
home.~~
